Ghit
=============

## What is this?

Ghit is a collection of custom ```git``` commands that allows the user to easily navigate to
certain Github pages of the repo (if it exists).

## Installation

    $ gem install ghit

That's it!

## Usage

There are 4 new ```git``` commands now.

The following commands allow you to easily navigate to repo's Github (sub)page.

* ```git wiki```    -> Opens the Github wiki page of the repo in browser.
* ```git pulls```   -> Opens the Github pull requests page of the repo in broswer.
* ```git issues```  -> Opens the Github issues page of the repo in broswer.
* ```git open```    -> Opens the Github repo page in browser.

## Worth sayin'
* Still has some rough edges. Needs tests, refactoring and various improvements.
